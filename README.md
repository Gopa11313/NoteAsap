Title:NoteASAP
  "NoteASAP" android application is built by using kotlin, nodejs for api, retrofit and coroutine. 
  there are following features of this android application.
  - anyone can signup and login to this system. 
  - anyone can download and upload any sorts of note.
  - anyone can give ratting to the notes.
  - anyone can comment on notes.
  - anyone can bookamrk the notes and delete and see the bookmarked note.
  - user can update their credentials 
  - user can also update their uploaded note.
  - user will be notified when someone uploads the note.
  - user can see the google maps location.
  - through the implementation of sensors different tasks such as changing the fragment with the help of gyroscope, triggering night mode with the help of light sensor, and               refereshing comments on notes with teh help of proximity sensor and logout with accelerometer is easy to do.
  - this application is compatble with different devices such as tablets and wear os.
  - in wear os user can login to wear os system and see the total number of notes avaliable in database
  - i have done two types of testing which is UI(instrumented) and unit(funcational). 
  - any user can send message to admin.
  these are the features of my application.
  
  Future work
  - in future user interfcae can be changed.
  - ratting of notes are working properly but in future, ratting notes features can be enhanced through different techniques.
  - in future we can enhanced sensor funtions.
  - in future we can implement search function.
  - in future we can also implement the features of update and delete the comments.
  
  the above points are the limitaion and the future work of this android application. Thank You.
